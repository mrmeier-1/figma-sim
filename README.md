# figma-sim
A simulation of designs using the Figma API

<<<<<<< Updated upstream
## The Plan

1.  A method to manipulate elements in virtual graphical environments with the following benefits:
    - Ability to take a frame with several UI elements.
    - Modify the position of elements within the frame.
    - Retrieve an image of the entire modified frame.
    - Element-Specific Data Extraction:

## Requirements
We're looking for a tool or software solution that offers the following capabilities:

**Figma Simulator:**
    - Ability to take a frame with several UI elements.
    - Modify the position of elements within the frame.
    - Retrieve an image of the entire modified frame.
**Element-Specific Data Extraction:**
    - Retrieve data about each element, especially their position, width, height, and color.
**Programmatic API for UI Element Manipulation:**
    - Remove UI elements from a frame.
    - Add new UI elements to a frame.
    - Update existing UI elements, at least their position, through a programmatic API.

## Tasks

To address these requirements, we'll need a combination of a design tool capable of such manipulations (like Figma itself or similar), coupled with a custom backend or script that can interact with the design tool's API. Hereâ€™s how we could approach each requirement:

### 1: Element-Specific Data Extraction
Retrieve data about each element, e.g. their position, width, height, and color. Figma's API provides extensive capabilities for extracting element-specific data from designs. We can retrieve details about each layer, including its position, size, and fill colors among other properties. This aspect is well-covered by the existing Figma API functionality.

### 2: Add / Edit and Remove UI elements Within a Frame on Figma
Update existing UI elements, at least their position, through a programmatic API.

### 3: Figma Simulator
Figma itself, along with its API, partially meets your simulation requirements. Figma's API allows for reading files and their elements, but direct manipulation of elements (like moving them around) through the API is limited. However, plugins within Figma can manipulate elements, which means a custom plugin might be necessary for full control over element positioning within frames.

### 4: Programmatic API for UI Element Manipulation
Adding and Removing Elements: Directly adding or removing elements via the Figma API is not supported as of my last update. Manipulations like these are typically done within the Figma application using plugins.
Updating Elements: While the Figma API allows for some level of modification (like changing styles or properties of elements), comprehensive manipulation (especially positioning) might require a plugin for more granular control.

## Solution Approach

1. **Use Figma for Design**: Continue using Figma for designing UI frames and elements.

2. **Develop a Custom Plugin**: To achieve the level of manipulation you desire (like moving elements around programmatically), you'd likely need to develop a custom Figma plugin. This plugin could facilitate modifying positions of elements within a frame and possibly support adding or removing elements.

3. **Leverage the Figma API**: For extracting element-specific data (position, size, color, etc.), use the Figma REST API. You can script interactions with the API to retrieve the necessary data programmatically.

4. **External Scripting for Automation**: For operations not supported directly by the Figma API or plugins, consider developing an external script or application that interacts with Figma through its API. This could involve more complex logic for adding, removing, or updating elements based on your specific requirements.

5. **Image Retrieval**: For retrieving images of the entire modified frame, the Figma API supports exporting frames as images. This functionality can be integrated into your workflow to get the final visual output after modifications.
